[BASIC]
GRAPHICS_OFFSET=0,-0.75,0.13				; 3 axis correction (x,y,z), applies only to the 3D object of the car (meters)
GRAPHICS_PITCH_ROTATION=0				; Changes 3D object rotation in pitch (degrees)
TOTALMASS=5005							; Total vehicle weight in kg with driver and no fuel
INERTIA=3.6 , 2.05 , 6.95					; Car polar inertia. Calculated from the car dimensions. Start with the generic width,height,length and modify accordingly to the car's configuration 

[GRAPHICS]
DRIVEREYES=0.635,2.035,-0.105					; 3 axis placement (x,y,z) of driver eyes (POV). in meters
ONBOARD_EXPOSURE=33							; Onboard camera exposure for HDR
OUTBOARD_EXPOSURE=31						; Outboard camera exposure for HDR
ON_BOARD_PITCH_ANGLE=-6.5558742				; Onboard driver eyes pitch angle relative to the horizon

STEER_RATIO=18.5							; Steer ratio
LINEAR_STEER_ROD_RATIO=0.00175				; Because of AC complex suspension geometry, you need to calculate manually the steer rod ratio
; Enter AC in dev app mode enabled
; Open SUSPENSIONS app
; turn your steering wheel by 90 degrees
; check the actual steer ratio value
; modify LINEAR_STEER_ROD_RATIO value until ingame steer ratio and car.ini STEER_RATIO values are similar
